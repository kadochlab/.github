# Welcome to the Kadoch Lab GitHub

We use this GitHub to share code and other resources used for illuminating the structure and function of large, macromolecular machines called ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, with an emphasis in dissecting their roles in human disease and identifying new therapeutic opportunities.
